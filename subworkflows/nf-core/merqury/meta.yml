name: "merqury"
description: Merqury is a tool for genome quality assessment that uses k-mer counts from raw sequencing data to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of a genome assembly. Meryl is the companion tool that efficiently counts and stores k-mers from sequencing reads, enabling Merqury to estimate metrics like assembly completeness and base accuracy. These tools provide a k-mer-based approach to assess assembly quality, helping to identify potential errors or gaps.â€‹
